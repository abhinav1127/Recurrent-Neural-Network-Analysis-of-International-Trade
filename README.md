# Recurrent-Neural-Network-Analysis-of-International-Trade
I am working with Dr. Usha Nair-Reichert to analyze current and past industrial-level trade relationships using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). As a step towards this goal, we are using RNNs to improve the prediction accuracy of overall international bilateral trade amounts, as described in this paper.
